CAPSTONE-PROJECT-Part-2 (Model Building part)

## Project to create Machine Learning models which correctly predicts  win for the Indian Cricket Team.
The major objective is to extract actionable insights from the historical cricket match data and make strategic changes to make India win.  Once a Machine Learning model is developed then we have to extract actionable insights and recommendation. If the model is predicting Indian Cricket team as loosing a match then make suitable changes in  various attributes, till the prediction changes to a win.

## Skills and Tools
Python, Ensemble, Machine Learning, Data Visualization, Exploratory Data Analysis

## Conclusion
After building various Machine Learning Models the best model is selected which predicted the results for upcoming five matches. If the win probability was low than various strategies/changes were applied and  model  was re-runned again until we got Win as a prediction, with good probability.
